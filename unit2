            <h3>Question 1</h3>
            <p>Describe the stages of memory according to the Atkinson-Shiffrin model, and explain how information is transferred between these stages.</p>
            <h3>Answer</h3>
            <p>The Atkinson-Shiffrin model describes memory in three stages: sensory memory, short-term memory, and long-term memory. Sensory memory briefly holds sensory information. Attention transfers information to short-term memory, which holds information temporarily for analysis. Rehearsal and encoding transfer information to long-term memory, where it can be stored indefinitely. Retrieval processes can bring information back to short-term memory for use.</p>

            <h3>Question 2</h3>
            <p>Explain the difference between algorithms and heuristics in problem-solving, and provide examples of each.</p>
            <h3>Answer</h3>
            <p>Algorithms are step-by-step procedures that guarantee a solution, such as a mathematical formula. Heuristics are mental shortcuts that simplify decision-making but do not guarantee a solution. An example of an algorithm is the quadratic formula in mathematics. An example of a heuristic is using the rule of thumb "When in doubt, choose the middle option" when unsure about which answer to choose on a multiple-choice test.</p>
